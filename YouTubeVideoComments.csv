A drone is a robot. An analytics device that helps a human being make critical decisions is a Virtual Intelligence. A machine with the consciousness of a human being is an Artificial Intelligence. Put any of these ""minds""/systems in a body of a humanoid and it's an Android.

We may run into a memory RAM issue with Excel or it&#39;s limits of 1 million rows for a power pivot table solvable with custom code if need be (in actuality the issues is with RAM directly and virtual rows when first assembling the table as subtotals with a repeated row for every column). That get out of hand with 2000 medicine names and 5000 diagnosis names being repeated exponentially but if it just never made those virtual repeated rows, in fact I one by one have to turn them off to make a complete working template with al the columns. By far though Excel is still much more familiar to common users and with steps to two fold secure data by encrypting the documents with a password to open and requiring them as blank templates to start they are connected using with the database tier application user permissions login credentials later added by the user and then an DB connection string. under the hood it complex but with a file system command like Process.Start to a data tables folder we install into the universally addressable &quot;special folders&quot; within the front end of the back end it&#39;s click to open, type password click macro buttons which loops and prints in the MAR case the same kinds of records a 2 inch binder typically holds in color for use each month.

If I rate this video’s content, I’d say it is good, well-researched perhaps, and well-written, though the volume of information is rather low, where the attempts at humor take away from the limited time to offer the history on the subject.

The art of rhetoric is one of the seven main liberal arts historically taught. The delivery must be just as powerful as the information. It is hard to believe Jabriel is being sincere and not just following a well-written and researched script. Sure, Carrie Ann for Crash Course Computer Science did the same thing, but I wasn’t doubting that she didn’t know the material that she was delivering, like she had mastered it. There are a few things Jabriel can look into to make a more powerful and believable delivery, like how to improve the voice and going to the gym to boost testosterone. This can take years to improve, but it can be done. I encourage Jabriel to continue, grow, and learn from his experience teaching here.

There's something that bugs me about AI to this day though... which is something that always happens one way or another, but in context I guess it's worth discussing.


You see, this thing we have working  today shouldn't have been called Artificial Intelligence. It is being called like that because it's simpler, because marketing, because semantics loses to practicity, and a bunch of other stuff.


But the vast majority of what we really have working today is machine learning with a few very specific applications for artificial neural networks.


Intelligence is a very general, very broad concept in itself. But I'd argue that among traits that are often attributed to intelligence, the so called artificial intelligence hasn't gotten even half of the easier ones for an automated system to get just yet.


Logic, learning to a point, planning to a point, problem solving for very specific problems. That's about it. It leaves out creativity, critical reasoning, understanding, reasoning, emotional knowledge, and perhaps most important of all - self-awareness.


A huge part of the fears about AI stems from two distinct things about AI evolution. One is pretty clear and has to be addressed as soon as possible - the usage of AI by bad actors. So it's not about AI as an evil thing, it's about the power of the tool itself. Which is just the same fear of nuclear power. In the wrong hands, it could be employed to make peoples' lives miserable, if not outright end life altogether.
It's easy enough to understand how. A dictatorship that wants to control it's population could use all sorts of algorithms, neural networks, machine learning and so called AI related techniques to get the upper hand and give power and control to a central power. It is already being employed in this way. So we have to take action to stop it, lest we wanna conform to a life under oppressive control.
Likewise, AI could be employed to developed even more powerful weapons of mass destruction. Train an AI to run through millions of scenarios modifying a virus or tweaking a disease, there you go.


But there is another very distinct fear - about what happens when artificial intelligence algorithms becomes so sophisticated running in machines so powerful that they achieve something like self-awareness.

Some argue that we'd need something like general intelligence for something like that to happen, which seems almost unreachable right now. Some think we don't need to go that far.
